Jupyter Notebook is a web-based environment that enables interactive computing
in notebook documents. It allows you to create and share documents that contain
live code, equations, visualizations, and explanatory text. The Jupyter Notebook
system is extensively used in domains such as data cleaning and transformation,
numerical simulation, statistical modeling, machine learning, and much more.
This tutorial starts with a detailed overview of the Jupyter Notebook system and
its installation in different environments. Next you will learn to integrate the
Jupyter system with different programming languages such as R, Python,
JavaScript, and Julia; further, you'll explore the various versions and packages
that are compatible with the Notebook system. Moving ahead, you'll master
interactive widgets, namespaces, and working with Jupyter in multiuser mode.
Towards the end, you will use Jupyter with a big dataset and will apply all the
functionalities learned throughout the video.
